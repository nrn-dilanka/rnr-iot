# 🏭 Greenhouse Removal Complete - Industrial IoT Platform

## Overview
Successfully removed all greenhouse/agricultural functionality from the RNR IoT platform, transforming it into a purely industrial-focused IoT system.

## What Was Removed ✅

### Backend Components
- `backend/api/greenhouse_routes.py` - Complete greenhouse API endpoints
- All greenhouse-related database models and schemas
- Agricultural terminology in user profiles and documentation

### Frontend Components  
- `frontend/greenhouseApi.js` - Greenhouse API client
- All greenhouse UI components and forms
- Agricultural dashboard elements

### ESP32 Firmware
- `firmware/esp32_greenhouse/` - Complete greenhouse firmware directory
- Agricultural sensor configurations
- Crop monitoring and growth tracking code

### Documentation
- Removed agricultural references from README files
- Updated configuration guides to focus on industrial applications
- Cleaned up API documentation

## What Was Updated 🔄

### Terminology Changes
- "Irrigation systems" → "Industrial cooling systems"
- "Greenhouse zones" → "Industrial zones"
- "Smart Agriculture" → "Industrial IoT Systems"
- "Agricultural monitoring" → "Industrial equipment monitoring"

### User Profiles
- Updated professor research area from "Smart Agriculture" to "Industrial IoT Systems"
- Modified authentication roles to focus on industrial applications

### Water Management
- Converted agricultural irrigation to industrial water management
- Updated water system names and monitoring alerts
- Changed focus from crop watering to industrial cooling

## Current Platform Status 🚀
